# charity

An attempt at a Clojure Dojo to make a website for a charity where people could volunteer for specific jobs. 

We had intended to make the website look pretty by using Hiccup, but we were not successful. 

We also didn't get around to implementing the ability to add new jobs, volunteers, etc.
